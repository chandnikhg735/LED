# LED
An Arduno library to drive a led in multiple modes to aid in multitasking.

LED creates a led object that can be turned on and off within a sketch and the library takes care of the blinking or breathing in the background.

See examples for usage.

To install, download the .zip file: https://github.com/markreds81/LED/archive/master.zip and rename the *LED-master* folder to *LED*.  Move the *LED* folder to your *Arduino/libraries* folder and restart the Arduino IDE.  This library should work for Arduino IDE v1.5 and newer.
